Why are we using postgresql database  instead of sqlite ?

PostgreSQL is the most advanced RDBMS ([object]-relational database management
system). PostgreSQL is the DBM that contains the most functionality of all the
other DBM's. PostgreSQL's to other DBMs like SQLite is mainly due to its
extensibility, or in other words, it's ability to be customized and tweaked.
On top of its customizability PostgreSQL also features stronger data integrity
than its other DBM counterparts such as SQLite.
